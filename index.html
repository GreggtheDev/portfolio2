        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi,<br>

I'm Gregg the Dev, full-stack web developer, currently enrolled in the <b>Cohort</b> program with <a href="https://stiegleredtech.org">Stiegler Edtech</a>. I specialize in crafting robust, scalable and dynamic web solutions for clients across various sectors including Charity, Retail, Education, Real Estate, and more. As a full-stack web developer, I handle <b>all</b> aspects of website development from conceptualization to launch. And my time with tech giants like <a href="https://apple.com">Apple</a> and <a href="https://verizon.com">Verizon</a> have imparted upon me a strong focus on the end-user experience and an eye for detail.</p> 

  <p>Whether it's developing responsive front-end interfaces or engineering powerful back-end systems, I ensure every piece of code is written with precision and purpose.</p>
